"""

Calculate the average wt. % and flux (kg/yr) by source of an element.
also returns global_flux

I want this to 
    - account for the fact that not all Macrostrat samples were matched, so some indices are 0
    - Be as generic as possible, i.e. don't do subindexing for a specific element (that should
        be done outside of the function)
    - return two NTuples, one with the wt.% and one with the flux by type
    - printout how many samples were not NaN
    - erosion, bulk_cats, crustal_area must contain the keys :siliciclast, :shale, :carb, :chert, 
    :evaporite, :coal, :sed,
    :volc, :plut, :ign,
    :metased, :metaign, :met,
    :cryst (others ok)

# Arguments
- `crustal_density::Number=2750`: Average crustal density (kg/mÂ³).
- `elem::String=""`: Element being analyzed, for terminal printout
