"""

Calculate the average wt. % and flux by source of an element.

I want this to 
    - account for the fact that not all Macrostrat samples were matched, so some indices are 0
    - Be as generic as possible, i.e. don't do subindexing for a specific element (that should
        be done outside of the function)
    - return two NTuples, one with the wt.% and one with the flux by type

# Arguments
- `crustal_density::Number=2750`: Average crustal density (kg/mÂ³).
